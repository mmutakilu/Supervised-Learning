# Goldfish Lifespan Prediction

## Overview
Welcome to the Goldfish Lifespan Prediction Project! This project aims to predict the lifespan of goldfish using advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and three different linear regression models: linear regression, Lasso regression, and Ridge regression. The best-performing model is deployed as a Gradio app, allowing users to interactively predict the lifespan of goldfish based on various features.
