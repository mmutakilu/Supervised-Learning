# Goldfish Lifespan Prediction
This project aims to predict the lifespan of goldfish using linear regression models. 
The project showcases advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) with compelling visualizations and 
demonstrates the implementation of three linear regression models: linear, lasso, and ridge regressions. 
Additionally, hyperparameter gridsearch is employed to optimize the performance of each model, and the best-performing model is deployed as a Gradio app.
