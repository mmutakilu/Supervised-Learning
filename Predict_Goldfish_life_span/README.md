# Goldfish Lifespan Prediction

## Overview
Welcome to the Goldfish Lifespan Prediction Project! This project aims to predict the lifespan of goldfish using advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and three different linear regression models: linear regression, Lasso regression, and Ridge regression. The best-performing model is deployed as a Gradio app, allowing users to interactively predict the lifespan of goldfish based on various features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project includes advanced EDA techniques to gain insights into the goldfish lifespan dataset. Visualizations are used to explore relationships between different features and understand their impact on the target variable. Below are some of the findings from the EDA:

## Linear Regression Models
Three linear regression models are implemented in the project:

- Linear Regression: The classic linear regression model.
- Lasso Regression: A linear regression model with L1 regularization to handle feature selection.
- Ridge Regression: A linear regression model with L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
- 
Hyperparameter grid search is performed to find the best hyperparameters for each model, ensuring optimal performance.
