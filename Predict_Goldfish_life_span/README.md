## Overview
Welcome to the Goldfish Lifespan Prediction Project! This project aims to predict the lifespan of goldfish using advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and three different linear regression models: linear regression, Lasso regression, and Ridge regression. The best-performing model is deployed as a Gradio app, allowing users to interactively predict the lifespan of goldfish based on various features.

## Linear Regression Models
Three linear regression models are implemented in the project:

- Linear Regression: The classic linear regression model.
- Lasso Regression: A linear regression model with L1 regularization to handle feature selection.
- Ridge Regression: A linear regression model with L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
- 
Hyperparameter grid search is performed to find the best hyperparameters for each model, ensuring optimal performance.
